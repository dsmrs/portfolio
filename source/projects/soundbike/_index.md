Player Wood is a side and _work in progress_ project to gain skills on IoT and electronics while making a pretty object. The idea is to build a mp3 player from a _Raspberry pi zero_ and I would like to build a beautiful case in wood. The best would be to fake a screen behind the wood itself by making a part of it really thin with a [matrix of LEDs](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-phat-hd) behind.

Back in 2014 I made a small project for a housewarming. The guests at the party had to pedal on an exercise bike to put the volume on of the music. If they stop the volume start to decrease. The tools I used was a exercise bike, a bike speedometer, an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) and some AppleScript on my MacBook to control the volume.
