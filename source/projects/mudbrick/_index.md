As an appendix of my master thesis (collective thesis at 3 students, two from economic studies and one engeneering (me)), I made a consulting work to try to find the best "earth mix" for _Tuibake Pamue_, a small company in Kasa√Ø, DRCongo.

The goal was to find the best ratio of locals sand, earth and gravel the make a strong brick that does not need to be fired.

I made 3 samples with or without 	stabilizer (lime) that I tested in laboratory.
