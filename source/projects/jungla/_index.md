After working on the web app of [Sortlist](https://sortlist.com), with some first responsabilities, like the chat between clients and agencies. I've started to build my first mobile app project in 2017 called **Jungla**. the goal is to discover the hidden spots in Medellin trough a fun way. The first iteration is just a map with the best places of the city.

Techs used: [Ionic 3](http://ionicframework.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Facebook (graph api & login) and Google Maps

With the same technology, Ionic 3, I've developed also a mobile app ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/myskillcamp/id1337766745"><i class="fab fa-app-store-ios"></i></a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myskillcamp.mobile"><i class="fab fa-google-play"></i></a>) for [MySkillCamp](https://myskillcamp.com/)
