I used to be terrible in languages at school (I was learning English and Dutch at that time). But by traveling or just meeting people from others cultures, I rediscovered the power of languages.

I've now developed my learning path to acquiring a new language the more efficiently.

Now, I try to improve or learn at least
one language per year.
