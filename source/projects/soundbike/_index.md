A small project for a housewarming made in 2014 (updated with my new code skill in 2018).

The guests at the party had to pedal on an exercise bike to put the volume on of the music. If they stop the volume start to decrease.

Tech used: A bike speedometer, an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) and AppleScript.
