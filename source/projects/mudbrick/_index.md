As an appendix of my master thesis made in 2013-2014, I made a consulting work to try to find the best "earth mix" for _Tuibake Pamue_, a small company in Kasa√Ø, DRCongo.

The goal was to find the best ratio of locals sand, earth, and gravel the make a strong brick that does not need to be fired. After a strong analysis of the different materials, I made 3 samples with or without stabilizer (lime) that I tested in a laboratory.
