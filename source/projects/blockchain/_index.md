By the end of 2016 I started to be curious about blockchain. Not by the cryptocurrencies, but more by the technology behind it and the potential of decentralized applications.

Lately, I decided to learn about how to code Smart Contracts in [Solidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity) and how to interact with a Ethereum node through [RPC/web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/). In the learning process what I love the most is to rapidly teach what I've learned so far. So I started to build a course to teach how to use Smart Contract in a blockchain, starting with a first Meetup.
