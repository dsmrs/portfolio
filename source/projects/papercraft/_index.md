Still for the [TEDx event in 2013](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/6673), I've designed the program prospectus. The theme was _From unique individuals to collective impact_, the idea was when the program is in his pocket only one hole is red (individual), but when we take the program over, all of them start to be red (collective).

As a souvenir, I've learned how to do *book binding*, and I've bound the 400 pages of my master thesis.
