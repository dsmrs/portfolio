After working on the web app of [Sortlist](https://sortlist.com), with some first responsabilities, like the chat between clients and agencies. I've started to build my first mobile app project in 2017 called **Jungla**. the goal is to discover the hidden spots in Medellin trough a fun way. The first iteration is just a map with the best places of the city.

The technologies I used was [Ionic 3](http://ionicframework.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), Facebook (graph api & login) and Google Maps. With Ionic 3, I've also developed a mobile app for [MySkillCamp](https://myskillcamp.com/) that you can find here <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/myskillcamp/id1337766745"><i class="fab fa-app-store-ios"></i></a> or here <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myskillcamp.mobile"><i class="fab fa-google-play"></i></a>)

Jungla has been designed by [Caroline Tribut](http://atelierblick.com/)
