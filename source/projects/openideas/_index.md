In 2012, while I started my study in entrepreneurship, I started to write all my ideas in a notebook. As a creative process, I write every single idea even the more stupid one, today I have more than 160 in it. In 2015, I've discovered the open source world and I've started a small blog call [Morses](http://mors.es).

I'm convinced that the more you share an idea, the more it evolve for a better. In 2017, I push some ideas of my notebook online on a fake platform I called **OpenIdeas**. It's just a draft of what I would like to imagine to be the _Github of ideas_.
