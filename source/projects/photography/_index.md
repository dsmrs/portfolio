In 2011, I've learned the basics of photography. Ever since I try sometimes to go out with my cheap camera and take some pictures.

For a _video cut_ post Young Camp in Morocco in 2011, I made a intro and outro with Adobe After Effect. Then the main video cut was build with Sony Vegas Pro. After that first experience, for some holiday video projects, I learned how to use _Final Cut Pro X_ back in 2012.

Never attempt to be a pro. Just enough to be able to cut some short videos.
