I have always been a music-lover. As a kid, I was "shaking my ass" on the first note. But time and shyness/embarrassment changed that.

In 2010 I decided to regain control of my body. First with a feeble start with _rock'n roll_ and _salsa_. But in 2017, I discovered _forr√≥_ and I fell in love with that dance.
