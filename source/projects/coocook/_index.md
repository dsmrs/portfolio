_Coocook_, a project with two other guys (Marc and Antoine), was incubated as a startup during 3 months in 2015. We wanted to test the feasibility to build a marketplace for food exchange between neighbors with the idea to donate the profit made by the food to non-profit projects.

The project has been abandoned but I still learned a lot from that experience, especially from the _lean startup method_.
